# SoDS17
My Summer of Data Science Project 2017

My name is Mark Lowerison,  I am a PhD Student in Biostatistics in the department of Community Health Sciences, in the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

I have decided to identify and post a Summer of Data Science Project to encourage myself to dig into a methodological question that I have been thinking through for a few years.  I will post and share what I do as I go through it.  I will endeavour to answer any questions anyone has about why I decide to do things the way I will, and I hope to receive some constructive input from the SoDS community.

Have a great Summer
